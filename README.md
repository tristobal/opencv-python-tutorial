## OpenCV conventions

* The RBG color model standard for OpenCV is: Blue, Green, Red (in that order).
* In OpenCV the X is positive from left ro right, but Y is from top to bottom. So the origin of the images is the upper
  left corner.
* The image as matrix is [y, x]
* In OpenCV HSL have the following values:
  * Hue [0, 180]
  * Saturation [0, 255]
  * Value [0, 255]
